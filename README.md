# Readable Project - Udacity Nanodegree
For the Readable project, you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

### Pre-requisites
Before being able to run this application, you must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.

Open a terminal, install the project dependencies and start the server.
```sh
# Cloning repository, do this while you're in the folder where you which to add this project's folder
$ git clone git@github.com:VanessaEly/reactnd-project-readable.git
